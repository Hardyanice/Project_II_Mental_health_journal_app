EDA_project:
- Combined EDA for all datasets used in the project

Module_1:
This module contains 3 classifiers- 
- one for detecting presence of negative self talk in jorunal entries.
- a binary classifier for detecting presence of cogniitve distortion.
- a multiclass classifier to detect type of distortion present in the sentences.

- We have combined these into 2 pipeline '.pkl' files:
  1. Pipeline for negative self talk detection
  2. Pipeline for sequential binary and multiclass classification of cogniitve distortion.
